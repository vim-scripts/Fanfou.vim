The fanfou.vim plugin is a simple UNOFFICIAL client for Fanfou.com (饭否), it allows you
to check timeline and update status via Vim.

NOTE: fanfou.vim requires Vim to be compiled with Python bindings. 
              It needs Vim with Python3 bindings after v0.50.


This plugin defines four commands:

    FanTimeline - View latest timeline from Fanfou in preview window
    FanUpdate - Update status in command line
    FanUpline - Send the line which is cursor on
    FanRT - Retweet the line which is cursor on

Default key mappings:

    <leader>fft is mapped to FanTimeline,
    <leader>ffu is mapped to FanUpdate,
    <leader>ffs is mapped to FanUpline.
    <leader>ffr is mapped to FanRT.
